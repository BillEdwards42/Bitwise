            Not too long ago, the idea of machines surpassing human capabilities sounded
            absurd. Today, that ‘absurdity’ is, in many cases, the reality. From
            backoffices run by automated systems to factories run by automated robots,
            automated machines have overtaken tasks once deemed the exclusive domain of
            skilled professionals. In today’s world, most jobs are still done by humans.
            The customer support you’re calling for a defect, the software engineer
            coding the product you’re using right now, the creators of the content you
            watch. Though done by humans today, that doesn’t mean it’ll still be the
            case in the future. Technologies have a strong tendency to improve as time
            goes by, and when they get good enough, they become an integral part of our
            life without our consent.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p dir="ltr">
            The Backroom Revolution
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            In the mid-20th century, banks, insurance companies, and government agencies
            operated enormous “backrooms” staffed by clerks who manually typed, sorted,
            and cross-referenced a sea of paperwork. Early computers—like IBM’s 650 or
            the UNIVAC I—were bulky beasts costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
            Their punch-card systems were prone to jams, data corruption, and constant
            mechanical breakdowns. Many executives scoffed at the idea that these
            unreliable monstrosities could outperform a squad of well-trained clerks,
            especially given that human workers were typically more flexible and cost
            less than a massive mainframe plus its dedicated crew of technicians.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            But over the following decades, exponential improvements in microprocessor
            speeds, memory storage, and chip design radically changed the landscape. A
            1960s IBM mainframe that filled an entire room offered less processing power
            than a basic smartphone today. By the 1980s, large institutions were already
            swapping out file cabinets for digital records, drastically reducing the
            need for manual data entry. Today, data entries and maintenance were mainly
            done through automated workflows. Large data centers hold servers after
            servers to store data that companies collect around the globe, which makes
            the idea of having a human to collect data manually and store it in a
            cabinet now seems like a joke. The transformation to these automated back
            office systems seem only natural.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p dir="ltr">
            The Internet Revolution
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Few inventions have been as transformative—or initially underestimated—as
            the Internet. Conceived in the 1960s as part of the U.S. Department of
            Defense’s ARPANET, it was originally a military-academic experiment,
            designed for secure and resilient data exchange among a small group of
            researchers. Early critics questioned the practicality of linking computers
            across vast distances, suggesting it was too expensive, too specialized, and
            too fraught with technical hurdles to become mainstream.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Over time, however, improvements in networking protocols (like TCP/IP), the
            rise of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, and the gradual drop in
            computing costs turned the Internet into an unprecedented communication
            superhighway. By 1995, it was estimated that around 16 million people
            worldwide were using the Internet—a number that exploded to more than 300
            million by 2000, and over 5 billion today. What started as a hard-to-access
            system for government labs became a global lifeline, underpinning everything
            from commerce and education to entertainment and social connectivity.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Along the way, it decimated industries reliant on older human-driven
            models—travel agencies, classified ads, and countless middleman services
            were replaced or reimagined as digital platforms. This technology that was
            once deemed too “academic” and “niche” has reshaped how we work, learn, and
            interact, changing our world completely. Today, the idea of borrowing books,
            mailing letters, even to an extent, going to a movie theater, seems
            impractical. The transformation to using the internet in our day to day
            lives seems only natural.

        <p dir="ltr">
            The Mobile revolution
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While landline telephones were already fixtures in most households by the
            late 20th century, mobile phones had a humbler and more skeptical start.
            Early models were shaped like actual “bricks” with limited battery life,
            geared primarily toward businesspeople who could shoulder the high cost.
            Even the first BlackBerry devices in the early 2000s—lauded for secure
            email—looked clunky and had tiny keyboards, prompting many consumers to
            question how these miniature communication hubs could ever beat out laptops
            or desktop computers.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Yet, as network speeds improved, hardware got smaller, and user interfaces
            became more intuitive, smartphones grew into powerhouses that could check
            emails, run sophisticated apps, browse the web, and even handle tasks once
            impossible for a handheld device. Apple’s iPhone launch in 2007
            revolutionized the entire mobile industry; within a few years, it displaced
            older phone models and accelerated the smartphone’s global adoption. By
            2011, smartphone sales had already overtaken PC sales worldwide—a decisive
            signal that these once “impractical” or “business-only” devices had become
            the primary tool for communications and productivity, once it became good
            enough. Today, the idea of not owning a mobile phone itself makes you an
            oddity. The transformation from clunky, costly “bricks” for a few to sleek,
            indispensable companions for most now seems only natural.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p dir="ltr">
            The ongoing AI revolution
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            All of these technologies started out impractical, costly, and unperformant.
            But overtime, as innovations, computing power, chip designs manufacturing
            progress, the technology becomes good enough and more use cases emerge,
            replacing humans in many areas and creating jobs in more. Now, since the
            emergence of ChatGPT in 2022, deep learning, or to most, Artificial
            Intelligence, has become the newest—potentially most transformative wave
            of—technology. It automates repetitive jobs, augments human work, and does
            it all with a chat bot. It may not seem like it is ready to fully take jobs
            from humans yet, but history has shown that with technology, it is only a
            matter of time that it becomes “good enough”. And when it becomes good
            enough, it will become our standard, without consent.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            What AI is different from prior waves of technology innovation is that, in
            its purest form, its goal is to outright replace humans, instead of
            augmenting them. Why hire a human to use AI, when you can just hire an AI to
            do the job? They currently lack intuition, so must be leveraged by a human
            being sitting in front of a computer. Will this always be the case? With
            time, won’t companies develop ways to remove the middleman—the human using
            the AI—and simply pay for the AI to do the work? Ofcourse, this will take
            time, and that is exactly the point. Enterprises will have to restructure
            their companies or even their definition of jobs to work around the AI
            agents they want to hire, and AI agents need to be built properly by the
            software companies first. One day, it might not be humans using services on
            the internet to finish tasks, it might be AI using services on the internet
            to finish tasks, rendering large swaths of humanity useless. This is not a
            fairy tale. The newly launched ChatGPT operator already has the ability to
            use an internet browser and perform tasks—buying tickets, shopping for
            groceries, making reservations—on the user's behalf. Though not close to
            human level, these AIs are indeed, as its name, competing for the position
            of the “operator”. It’s nice to have them doing these little tasks for you,
            but you will not think that when it's coming for your job. If the above
            histories tell us anything, it's that once the technology has been created,
            it will only get better and better overtime.

            Accept and adapt

        <p dir="ltr">
            “Wow, we’re utterly fucked” might be a thought that passes through your
            mind. I hope the understanding that with time, the computing cost will only
            go down, and there will only be more, not less, innovations, will help you
            accept the fact that AI really might one day replace your, and most other
            human’s jobs. What we see now is a mere beginning, and it's scary enough.
            Who knows. Maybe after twenty or thirty years, most of us will be on UBI
            (Universal Basic Income) while only some doing very demanding jobs. Does
            that mean you should stop working now and accept the fact that you’ll be
            replaced? No! That day is not even close yet. If you are afraid of being
            replaced by AI, in my opinion, there are four things that you can do.

                    1. Become the minds behind the development of AI <br/>
                    Technology companies are pouring billions and billions of dollars to
                    fight for the ones with great technical expertise. If you are good
                    enough to become one of them, good for you! You’ll be part of the
                    process towards the next age of humanity and get paid handsomely for
                    that. Sadly, this is not the case for most, and probably not for
                    you.

                    2. Build a career in areas that will be hard to replaced by AI <br/>
                    The issue with this option is that how do you decide which areas
                    will be hard to replace? Any prediction entails the chance of being
                    wrong. With that in mind, one choice is to pursue careers in
                    esoteric fields that will take longer for AI to be better than you.
                    Chip designers, Software engineers, Accountants, doctors. Low level
                    positions of these fields might be replaced by AI, but if you can
                    become one of the best, it’ll be a very hard and very long process
                    for AIs to catch up to you! Next, outside of trying to be hard to
                    replace, you can try to be irreplaceable by pursuing certain fields
                    that are sometimes deemed unfit for AI. This is not due to its
                    technical difficulty, but its need for the human factor.
                    Entrepreneurs, Teachers, Lawyers, Psychiatrist, Waiters. These jobs
                    require physical human interaction and offline work, which is hard
                    for AI to do. Also, plumbers, construction workers, vehicle
                    repairers, these also require physical work, but more effort or
                    strength is needed, which protects you from the AI models in the
                    cloud. I say all this with the caveat that humanoids might one day
                    replace these jobs too, but it will take much longer.

                    3. Utilize the AI now and accumulate wealth <br/>
                    Most companies right now are not using AIs as direct employees,
                    though some are already trying. What you can do between the now and
                    the age of full bloom AI is to utilize the current AI to amplify
                    your ability now. Automate some of your workflows, utilize the
                    chatbots to enhance your work, achieve better results than others
                    that are not using the LLMs (Large Language Models, the chatbots).
                    Ideally, this will earn you a raise, promotion, or a better job
                    offer, as your performance will be augmented by AI while others
                    going about their work just the same as before. The companies are
                    not using AIs to do their work now, but you can. This is not to
                    encourage you to spend less time at work since AI can do a good
                    enough job, it is encouraging you to use it to better your
                    performance and differentiate yourself from others. You will be
                    arbitraging the fact that AI has not yet been adopted by the
                    enterprise world, but you had. You have until wide scale adoption of
                    AI agents from the companies and replacing humans instead of hiring
                    humans using AIs.

                    4. Invest in the companies that profit from AI adoptions <br/>
                    Don’t invest in the first big brand technology company name that
                    comes to mind. What we are trying to do here is to hedge against the
                    chance of losing your job to AIs. What will it mean when that
                    happens? AI agents will become good enough and cost effective enough
                    for companies to start firing employees and replacing them with AIs.
                    They won’t do this because they love technology, but because from a
                    cost analysis standpoint, they will be saving a lot of money and
                    still get the work done. They won’t need to pay for salaries,
                    employee insurances, or office rent. What they’ll need to pay for is
                    the fees for running the AI, possibly to an AI service provider, or
                    the cost of constructing a data center and service themselves. So,
                    in order to hedge against this, we need to also profit from this
                    transformation. Think about companies that will benefit from
                    deploying AI agents as their workforce, the companies that will save
                    lots of costs from this deployment. The considerations here would be
                    how much work this company is doing can benefit from AI agents?
                    Better yet, What company will benefit if my category of jobs gets
                    replaced? If you are very certain that your job will be replaced in
                    your company, see if your company will benefit in this kind of
                    situation and invest in them, this will be the most direct hedge for
                    losing your job to AI. But investing in your own company entails
                    risk of its own. If your company is on a downtrend or goes bankrupt,
                    both your salaries and investments are gone. Do a bit of research on
                    the essence of the stock market and the companies that will benefit
                    from this kind of situation, then allocate your assets according to
                    that.

            The days of the majority of humans getting replaced may still be far away,
            but rest assured that it is indeed gradually coming to reality. Some jobs
            will be easier to replace and get replaced first, then as the AI models keep
            getting better and better, more will lose their income. This is not to be
            pessimistic and negative about the future. No, I’m quite thrilled about it
            actually. This is a warning for what is to come, based on observations of
            technological history and enterprise decision making. The goal of this
            article is to convince the reader to accept the possibility of losing their
            jobs to AI and prepare accordingly. The internet and mobile both started
            mainly around the 2000s, and twenty years later, look at where we are, how
            fast we progressed. My view is that technology will only progress faster
            with all the prior technological advancements we made. I wish you the best
            and hey, thanks for reading.
